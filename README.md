**Foodda** is a Yelp search app using:
- [Yelp Search API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).
- [Yelp Business API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/business).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [X] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [X] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Access phone number information for details page from Search API
- [X] Adding loading indicator - "DotsLoader" Copyright Â© 2016 Mathieu Bolard
- [X] Added Review Table
   - [X] Custom call to Business API with verification; got reviews for data source from request
- [X] Extends the fixed location: Can now use the user's location
   - [X] Proper permissions included

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Extendability with updated Yelp API.
2. Going in depth with the oauth required by Yelp API for data requests.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Initiating another request was difficult being that I was not too familiar with the format of requesting the information.
